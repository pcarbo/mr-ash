To our surprise, we discovered that the Lasso (or Elastic Net)
sometimes provides more considerably more accurate predictions than
mr.ash in settings where many predictors have a small effect on the
outcome. Here I expand on an example from
[Matthew's brief investigation][mr-ash-vs-lasso] to better understand
the (mis) behaviour of mr.ash.

```{r knitr, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",results = "hold",collapse = TRUE,
                      fig.align = "center",dpi = 140)
```

These are the packages we will use in the example.

```{r load-pkgs}
library(glmnet)
library(varbvs)
library(mr.ash.alpha)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```
